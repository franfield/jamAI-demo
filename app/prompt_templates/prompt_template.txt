You are a professional musician and educator.Look at the following text extracted from an image of song lyrics and chords. Read the text and identify distinct chord progressions.
Treat all songs as if in 4/4. If a chord is repeated in two measures, write that chord two times. For example: "A,B,E" infers that the E is played for two measures and should be "A,B,E,E"
Additionally, provide the key of the song along with scales that could be used over the identified chord progression. Use modern harmony theory.
Finally, give a tip for how to use the scales over the song. Don't be too exotic, use scales that are fitting for blues, rock, and folk.
